# Ball_Classifier

Image Classification Deep Learning Project

## Overview

Here I have built a ball classifier that can identify balls from different sports. I have downloaded images of ball of over 15 different sports. This can come handy for someone who is new to sports & is not familiar with any particular sport. Any image of a ball can uploaded and the model can predict what category of sport (ex. cricket, football, soccer etc.) does the ball belong to. 

I was able to acheive an accuracy of almost 80%. I have used a transfer learning model resnet34 from PyTorch. 

## Tips:
Try to run this program on Google Colab and change the runtime type to gpu.
